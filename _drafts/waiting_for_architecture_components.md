So I'm waiting for architecture components to fix all my problems in android (mainly configuration changes). I'm watching a lot of talks about it. I've also seen [this one](https://academy.realm.io/posts/360-andev-2017-yigit-boyar-android-architecture-components/). It states that view models are based on headles fragments. Maybe I could implement something similar to feel the gap while waiting? Let's try!
