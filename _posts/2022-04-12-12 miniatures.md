12 miniatures, 5x5cm gouache on paper.  


I've found this excersice on [Tiffanie Mang](https://www.instagram.com/tiffaniemangart/) profile. Later I've leared that she did a whole [tutorial and challenge](https://www.proko.com/lesson/painting-landscape-thumbnails-step-by-step/discussions) about this :D . I've painted all of them using just 0,5in flat brush. It is amazing how much detail one can fit in such small space. I will definatelly try again in future.
