12 miniatures, 5x5cm gouache on paper.  


I've found this exercise on [Tiffanie Mang](https://www.instagram.com/tiffaniemangart/) profile. Later I've leared that she did a whole [tutorial and challenge](https://www.proko.com/lesson/painting-landscape-thumbnails-step-by-step/discussions) about this. There are some useful tips there. I've painted all of them using just 0,5 inch flat brush. It is amazing how much detail one can fit in such small space. I will definatelly try this exercise again in future.
