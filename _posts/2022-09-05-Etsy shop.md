I have started Etsy shop. 

I'm planning to sell my paintings there. If there would be interest I'm willing to sell prints as well.
I'm looking at ways to promote. I have an idea to sell my work as postard prints. This way it would be way cheaper and approachable.

Anyway, please have a look and happy shopping:
