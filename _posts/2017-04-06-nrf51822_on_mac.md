Programming embeded devices on mac can be sometimes tricky. Most of the software is dedicated to windows.   nrf51822 is a microchip with bluetooth low energy on board and mbed compatible. 

	1. buy board

	2. buy core board nrf51822
	3. buy debugger!

	all of those can be buyed a little bit cheaper on aliexpress/ebay
	4. download segger jlink software

	8. flash softdevice using script:
{% highlight bash %}
        ./nrfjprog.sh --flash-softdevice [softdevice_filename.hex]
